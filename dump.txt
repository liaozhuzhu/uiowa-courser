     This degree audit has been prepared to assist you in determining your academic progress
     at The University of Iowa. While efforts have been made to ensure its accuracy, final
     responsibility for meeting graduation requirements resides with you.

     The Office of the Registrar along with your major department will certify your
     successful completion of degree requirements.

     All 'in progress' (IP) courses must be completed satisfactorily to fulfill requirements.
     Courses taken to remove high school unit deficiencies do not count toward completion of
     the General Education Program, with the exception of Rhetoric and World Languages.

     If you have questions, please contact your advisor immediately.
